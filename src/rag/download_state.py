"""Background download/ingest job queue and dedup helpers.

Shared by both trigger paths for cited-paper download:

- Path A (regex auto): app.py extracts inline ``[X]`` citations from
  retrieved chunks via :func:`extract_inline_citations` and feeds each
  ``(source_paper_id, indices)`` pair to :func:`enqueue_citation_download`.
- Path B (LLM tool): the ``download_cited_papers`` tool calls the same
  :func:`enqueue_citation_download` directly when the user explicitly asks.

All state lives at module level so background threads can mutate it without
touching Streamlit's session state. The Streamlit UI reads
:func:`get_log_snapshot` / :func:`is_busy` on each rerun.
