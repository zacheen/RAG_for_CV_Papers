"""Cross-encoder reranker for second-stage retrieval refinement.

Initial vector retrieval (cosine similarity over MiniLM bi-encoder
embeddings) is fast but coarse — it ranks by query/document embedding
similarity which only loosely tracks true semantic relevance. A
cross-encoder takes the (query, candidate) pair as a single input and
produces a real relevance score at the cost of one model forward pass per
candidate (no embedding cache).

The pipeline becomes: ChromaDB returns top-N=20 candidates fast, the
cross-encoder reranks those 20 down to top_k=5. On CPU, scoring 20 pairs
takes ~50ms — small relative to the LLM generation step that follows.
